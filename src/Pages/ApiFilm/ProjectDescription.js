              This project is a web-based game where users try to guess movie titles using a Hangman-style game. The application consists of a frontend built with React and a backend developed using Python with FastAPI. The backend interacts with a MySQL database to fetch and store movie data. Below is a detailed explanation of the various components and their functionalities.

            <Paragraph>
              <b>Data Fetching:</b> When the GameFilm component mounts, it makes a request to the /movies endpoint to fetch a random movie. It then makes a POST request to the /moviesList endpoint with the movie title to get a list of related movies.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              <b>Game Logic:</b> The HangmanGame component initializes the game state, including the word to guess and the list of guessed letters. The user interacts with the game by clicking on letters or guessing the entire word. The component updates the state based on user input and checks for win/loss conditions.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              <b>Visual Feedback:</b> The Hangman component renders the Hangman figure dynamically based on the number of incorrect guesses. If the user wins, the movie poster is displayed; if the user loses, the full Hangman figure is shown, and the game is over.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              <b>Reload Functionality:</b> A reload button allows the user to start a new game with a new movie title, refreshing the component state and fetching new data from the API.
