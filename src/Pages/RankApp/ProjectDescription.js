            <Paragraph>
              <b>Data Fetching:</b> When a screen component mounts or the user performs an action, it makes a request to the appropriate backend endpoint to fetch or submit data. For example, the `CreateActivityScreen` posts a new activity to the backend, while `RankListScreen` retrieves the user's ranking data.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              <b>Form Handling:</b> Screens like `CreateActivityScreen` and `CreateRankListScreen` handle user input through forms. They validate input fields, provide feedback, and submit data to the backend for storage.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              <b>Navigation:</b> The app uses React Navigation to transition between screens. For example, after creating a new ranking list, users are navigated back to the rank list screen where the new ranking appears.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              <b>Interactive Components:</b> Components like `ListActivities` provide real-time search and selection functionality. They filter and display results based on user input, enhancing the user experience with responsive and dynamic interactions.
